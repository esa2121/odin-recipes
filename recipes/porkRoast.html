        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            This Slow Cooker Pork Roast With Vegetables Recipe is one of my favorite home-cooked comfort meals. 
            The pork turns out so tender, and the vegetables are cooked to perfection! This is perfect for feeding 
            just your family, hosting people, or needing a set-it-and-forget-it dinner! It warms the heart and the 
            home, but it also makes the house smell amazing at the same time!

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Spray your crockpot with a stick spray now I cooked this in an 8-quart Crockpot
                and used an 8lb Pork Shoulder Roast. For easy cleanup, you can use  in the crockpot when making this.
            </li>
            <li>
               Chop up your potatoes, onions, celery, and carrots into smaller pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start to pack the vegetables around the roast in the crockpot. With picky kids, I prefer to leave my celery and onions in bigger chunks for them to pick out.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season with salt, pepper, minced garlic, and seasonings.
            </li>
            <li>
                I used  to make mine, but you can use canned vegetable broth. Heat your water if need and then add in your better-than-bullion base,
                 and mix in the bowl until the base has dissolved all the way.  
            </li>
            <li>Pour the broth mixture all over the pork shoulder roast and vegetables, you will want to have a good amount of broth.</li>
            <li>Turn your crockpot on low and allow it to cook for 6 to 8 hours. </li>
        </ol>
